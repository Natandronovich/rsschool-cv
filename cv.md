### **About me**

I have a higher education in economics. I have been working in the banking system for more than 10 years. A few months ago I decided to try something new for myself. I started learning HTML, CSS and Javascript. I think frontend development is a good way for self-development and reaching new heights. I love to learn and develop, I want to become an active member of your team.

### **Skills**
